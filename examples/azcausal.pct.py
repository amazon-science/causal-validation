# # AZCausal Integration
#
# Amazon's [AZCausal](https://github.com/amazon-science/azcausal) library provides the
# functionality to fit synthetic control and difference-in-difference models to your
# data. Integrating the synthetic data generating process of `causal_validation` with
# AZCausal is trivial, as we show in this notebook. To start, we'll simulate a toy
# dataset.

# ## Fitting a model
#
# We now have some very toy data on which we may apply a model. For this demonstration
# we shall use the Synthetic Difference-in-Differences model implemented in AZCausal;
# however, the approach shown here will work for any model implemented in AZCausal. To
# achieve this, we must first coerce the data into a format that is digestible for
# AZCausal. Through the `.to_azcausal()` method implemented here, this is
# straightforward to achieve. Once we have a AZCausal compatible dataset, the modelling
# is very simple by virtue of the clean design of AZCausal.

# %%
panel = inflated_data.to_azcausal()
model = SDID()
result = model.fit(panel)
print(f"Delta: {TRUE_EFFECT - result.effect.percentage().value / 100}")
print(result.summary(title="Synthetic Data Experiment"))

# %% We see that SDID has done an excellent job of estimating the treatment [markdown]
# effect.  However, given the simplicity of the data, this is not surprising. With the
# functionality within this package though we can easily construct more complex datasets
# in effort to fully stress-test any new model and identify its limitations.
#
# To achieve this, we'll simulate 10 control units, 60 pre-intervention time points, and
# 30 post-intervention time points according to the following process: $$ \begin{align}
# \mu_{n, t} & \sim\mathcal{N}(20, 0.5^2)\\
# \alpha_{n} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1^2)\\
# \beta_{n} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0.05, 0.01^2)\\
# \nu_n & \sim \mathcal{N}(1, 1^2)\\
# \gamma_n & \sim \operatorname{Student-t}_{10}(1, 1^2)\\
# \mathbf{Y}_{n, t} & = \mu_{n, t} + \alpha_{n} + \beta_{n}t + \nu_n\sin\left(3\times
# 2\pi t + \gamma\right) + \delta_{t, n} \end{align} $$ where the true treatment effect
# $\delta_{t, n}$ is 5% when $n=1$ and $t\geq 60$ and 0 otherwise. Meanwhile,
# $\mathbf{Y}$ is the matrix of observations, long in the number of time points and wide
# in the number of units.
